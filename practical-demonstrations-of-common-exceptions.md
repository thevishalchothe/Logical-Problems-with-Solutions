### **Basic Exceptions** ‚ö†Ô∏è
This section contains Java programs demonstrating various common exceptions, along with a brief explanation for each. These exceptions are critical to understanding error handling in Java.

**1. Write a program to demonstrate `NullPointerException` in Java.**
   - _This exception occurs when you try to invoke a method or access a field on a null object reference._  
     - **Solution**: Accessing a method on a null object triggers a `NullPointerException`.

**2. Write a program to demonstrate `ArithmeticException` (division by zero) in Java.**
   - _It happens when an arithmetic operation, such as division by zero, is attempted._  
     - **Solution**: Dividing by zero causes an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown.

**3. Write a program to demonstrate `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in Java.**
   - _This exception is thrown when you try to access an invalid index of an array._  
     - **Solution**: Trying to access an invalid array index results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

**4. Write a program to demonstrate `ClassNotFoundException` in Java.**
   - _It occurs when a class is referenced but cannot be found during runtime._  
     - **Solution**: When a class cannot be found at runtime, a `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown.

**5. Write a program to demonstrate `FileNotFoundException` in Java.**
   - _This exception is thrown when an attempt to open a file fails because it does not exist._  
     - **Solution**: Trying to open a non-existent file leads to a `FileNotFoundException`.

**6. Write a program to demonstrate `NumberFormatException` in Java.**
   - _It happens when you try to convert a string into a numeric type, but the string format is incorrect._  
     - **Solution**: An invalid string format leads to a `NumberFormatException`.

**7. Write a program to demonstrate `IllegalArgumentException` in Java.**
   - _Thrown when a method receives an argument that is inappropriate or illegal for its operation._  
     - **Solution**: Passing an inappropriate argument triggers an `IllegalArgumentException`.

**8. Write a program to demonstrate `IOException` in Java.**
   - _This exception is thrown when an I/O operation (like reading or writing a file) fails._  
     - **Solution**: An I/O operation failure throws an `IOException`.

**9. Write a program to demonstrate `ConcurrentModificationException` in Java.**
   - _It occurs when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over._  
     - **Solution**: Modifying a collection while iterating it results in a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

**10. Write a program to demonstrate `TimeoutException` in Java.**
   - _Thrown when a blocking operation exceeds the time limit._  
     - **Solution**: A blocking operation exceeding the time limit results in a `TimeoutException`.

**11. Write a program to demonstrate `SQLException` in Java.**
   - _This exception occurs when there is an issue related to database connectivity, SQL query syntax, invalid database access, or issues with database resources like a timeout or failure to establish a connection._  
     - **Solution**: A `SQLException` can be thrown due to various reasons, such as incorrect SQL syntax, issues with the database connection (e.g., network problems, unavailable database server), invalid query parameters, or resource limitations during query execution.
